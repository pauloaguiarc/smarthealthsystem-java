# 🏥 Smart Health System

## Overview

**Smart Health System** is a Java-based healthcare management application designed to streamline the organization of patients, doctors, appointments, and prescriptions. The system provides an efficient way for medical professionals and administrators to manage healthcare records, track upcoming appointments, and monitor patient prescriptions in a structured and automated manner.

This project demonstrates the application of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles in Java, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, while maintaining a modular and maintainable code architecture.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Patient Management:** Create and manage patient records with essential medical and personal details.
* **Doctor Management:** Register and track doctors along with their specialties and assigned patients.
* **Appointment Scheduling:** Schedule, update, and list upcoming appointments between patients and doctors.
* **Prescription Tracking:** Maintain detailed records of prescribed medications and track their expiration dates.
* **Data Relationships:** Each module (Doctor, Patient, Appointment, Prescription) interacts through well-defined object associations.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Language:** Java
* **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
